# Pose-Detection-of-Squats

## Objective
This project implements a basic pose detection system using a pre-trained model. The system processes a video of a person performing squats and detects key pose points (e.g., shoulders, hips, knees). It also calculates the knee bend angle in each frame and outputs the angle sequence.


## Features
1.Pose Detection: Utilizes Mediapipe's pre-trained pose estimation model
2.Landmark Detection: Identifies key body points including:
     *Shoulders
     *Hips
     *Knees
     *Ankles

3.Angle Calculation: Computes knee bend angle for each frame
4.Output Analysis: Generates a sequence of angles for detailed review

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
1.Python 3.7 or later
2.OpenCV
3.Mediapipe


## Installation
Install the dependencies using pip:
pip install opencv-python mediapipe
